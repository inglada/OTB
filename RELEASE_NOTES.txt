OTB-v.1.2.0 - Changes since version 1.0.2
-----------------------------------------

- Added support for ObjectList (ie SmartPointers) and thus support
  for ImageList.

- Added base classes for image to Images list filters, images list to 
  image filters, images list to images list filters.

- Added filters for multiscale analysis and synthesis based on the 
  morphological pyramid algorithm.

- Added automated region-growing multi-scale segmentation algorithm 
  based on the morphological pyramid analysis.

- Added support for graph representation of RCC8 spatial reasonning 
  relationships.

- Added filters for atomic RCC8 calculation based on two segmented regions.

- Added filter for multi-scale segmentation to RCC8 graph calculation with 
  optimisations.

- Added filters for learning, classification and activation map of data sets
  using Kohonen's self organizing maps.

- Refactoring of the base classes for visualisation.

- Refactoring of the viewer object (and viewer apps). The viewer can now be 
  used to visualised large remote-sensing images with limited memory occupation.

- Added full support (reading and writing) of the HFA image format (img files).

- Precision for internal calculus has been tuned to double in every filter.

- Bugfixes on metada writing (now works for tif and HFA formats, limited support 
  envi header file formats due to Gdal limitations).

- Bugfixes on memory management in the Reader.

- Various bugfixes and warning corrections.

       - SunOS 5.8 (32bits and 64bits).

       - the Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003 (7.1), .NET 2005 (8.0) 
       - the Cygwin and MinGW 
  installation.
  

- Minor changes needed for the portability of OTB-Applications.

- Bugfixes related to the IO framework on MS Windows platforms.

Note : On MS Windows platforms, if you have any problem related 
       to using the OTB's internal version of ITK, you could try to use 
       an external version of ITK (use ITK 2.6 or later) by setting 
       OTB_USE_EXTERNAL_ITK to ON and ITK_DIR to the directory where 
       your ITK built resides.

       
OTB-v.1.0.1 - Changes since version 1.0.0

- Minor changes needed for the portability of OTB-Applications.

- Bugfixes related to the IO framework on MS Windows platforms.

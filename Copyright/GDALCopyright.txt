The following terms are the same as X windows is released under, and is generally known as the "MIT License". It is intended to give you permission to do whatever you want with the GDAL source, including building proprietary commercial software, without further permission from me, or requirement to distribute your source code. A few portions of GDAL under under slightly different terms. For instance the libpng, libjpeg, libtiff, and libgeotiff license terms may vary slightly though I don't think any of them differ in any significant way. Some external libraries which can be optionally used by GDAL are under radically different licenses.

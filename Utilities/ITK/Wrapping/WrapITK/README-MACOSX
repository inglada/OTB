IMPORTANT NOTE

WrapITK is incompatible with all versions of Python before 2.5 on OS X and 
Darwin platforms. This is due to a subtle bug/limitation in Python on these
platforms that was patched in version 2.5.

Unfortunately, Python 2.5 is itself subtly incompatible with the current
version of CableSWIG. In addition, CMake doesn't properly find Python 2.5.
These limitations will be lifted soon; however until then a few CMake 
variables must be manually set in order to compile WrapITK with Python 2.5.

To deal with CableSWIG:
 CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS           -fpermissive

To find a standard "framework" install of Python:
 PYTHON_DEBUG_LIBRARY      -framework Python
 PYTHON_EXECUTABLE         /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python
 PYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH       /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/include/python2.5
 PYTHON_LIBRARY            -framework Python


If you prefer to use a previous verison of Python, it is possible to
manually apply the patch and rebuild python yourself.
The patch is available here:
http://www.python.org/sf/1454844
or
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1454844&group_id=5470&atid=305470
The patch ('darwin_use_dlopen2.patch') has been tested with Python
versions 2.3 and 2.4, and will work on OS X 10.3 and later.

Welcome to the National Library of Medicine Insight Segmentation and Registration
Toolkit (ITK).<br>
<br>
This document provides a brief description of the project, its history, and
references to additional information describing how to use, develop, and
contribute to ITK. <br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>What is <a href="http://www.itk.org">ITK</a>?</h3>
ITK is an open-source software toolkit for performing registration and segmentation.
Segmentation is the process of identifying and classifying data found in
a digitally sampled representation. Typically the sampled representation
is an image acquired from such medical instrumentation as CT or MRI scanners.
Registration is the task of aligning or developing correspondences between
data. For example, in the medical environment, a CT scan may be aligned with
a MRI scan in order to combine the information contained in both.<br>
<br>
ITK is implemented in C++. In addition, an automated wrapping process generates
interfaces between C++ and interpreted programming languages such as Tcl,
Java, and Python. This enables developers to create software using a variety
of programming languages. ITK's C++ implementation style is referred to as
generic programming. Such C++ templating means that the code is highly efficient,
and that the many software problems are discovered at compile-time, rather
than at run-time during program execution.<br>
<br>
Because ITK is an open-source project, developers from around the world can
use, debug, maintain, and extend the software. ITK uses a model of software
development referred to as Extreme Programming. Extreme Programming collapses
the usual software creation methodology into a simultaneous and iterative
process of design-implement-test-release. The key features of Extreme 
Programming are communication and testing. Communication among the members of 
the ITK community is what helps manage the rapid evolution of the software. 
Testing is what keeps the software stable. In ITK, an extensive testing 
process is in place that measures the quality on a daily basis.<br>

<h3>What are ITK's origins?</h3>

In 1999 the US <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/nlmhome.html">National Library
of Medicine</a> of the National Institutes of Health awarded a three-year
contract to develop an open-source registration and segmentation toolkit,
which eventually came to be known as the Insight Toolkit (ITK). The primary
purpose of the project is to support the <a
href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/visible/visible_human.html"> Visible
Human Project</a> by providing software tools to process and work with the
project data. ITK's NLM Project Manager was Dr. Terry Yoo, who coordinated
the six prime contractors who made up the Insight Software Consortium. These
consortium members included the three commercial partners GE Corporate
R&amp;D, Kitware, Inc., and MathSoft (the company name is now Insightful);
and the three academic partners University of North Carolina (UNC),
University of Tennessee (UT), and University of Pennsylvania (UPenn).  The
Principle Investigators for these partners were, respectively, Bill Lorensen
at GE CRD, Will Schroeder at Kitware, Vikram Chalana at Insightful, Stephen
Aylward with Luis Ibanez at UNC (Luis is now at Kitware), Ross Whitaker with
Josh Cates at UT (both now at Utah), and Dimitri Metaxas at UPenn (now at
Rutgers). In addition, several subcontractors rounded out the consortium
including Peter Raitu at Brigham &amp; Women's Hospital, Celina Imielinska
and Pat Molholt at Columbia University, Jim Gee at UPenn's Grasp Lab, and
George Stetton at University of Pittsburgh.  <br>

<h3> Who are the developers?</h3>
The best way to determine the names of developers is to view the CVS
source code repository logs. Most of the early developers are listed in

<h2>TECHNICAL SUMMARY</h2>
The following sections summarize the technical features of the NLM's Insight
ITK toolkit.
<h3>Design Philosophy</h3>
The following are key features of the toolkit design philosophy.<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>The toolkit provides data representation and algorithms for performing
segmentation and registration. The focus is on medical applications; although
the toolkit is capable of processing other data types.<br>
 </li>
  <li>The toolkit provides data representations in general form for images
(arbitrary dimension) and (unstructured) meshes.<br>
 </li>
  <li>The toolkit does not address visualization or graphical user interface.
These are left to other toolkits (such as 
<a href="http://www.vtk.org">VTK</a>, 
<a href="http://rolle.engr.utk.edu/~vision/vispack/">VisPack</a>, 
<a href="http://mipgsun.mipg.upenn.edu/~Vnews/">3DViewnix</a>,
<a href="http://caddlab.rad.unc.edu/technologies/index.html#metaObjects">
MetaImage</a>, etc.)
  </li>
  <li> The toolkit provides minimal tools for file interface. Again, this
is left to other toolkits/libraries to provide. </li>
  <li>Multi-threaded (shared memory) parallel processing is supported. </li>

  <li>The development of the toolkit is based on principles of extreme
programming.  That is, design, implementation, and testing is performed in a
rapid, iterative process. Testing forms the core of this process. In Insight,
testing is performed continuously as files are checked in, and every night
across multiple platforms and compilers. The 
<a href="http://public.kitware.com/dashboard.php?name=itk">Insight testing 
dashboard</a>, where testing results are posted, is central to this
process.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Architecture </h3>
The following are key features of the toolkit architecture.
<ul>
  <li>The toolkit is organized around a data-flow architecture. That is,
data is represented using data objects which are in turn processed by process
objects (filters). Data objects and process objects are connected together
into pipelines. Pipelines are capable of processing the data in pieces according
to a user-specified memory limit set on the pipeline.</li>
  <li>Object factories are used to instantiate objects. Factories allow run-time
extension of the system. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Implementation Philosophy</h3>
The following are key features of the toolkit implementation philosophy.<br>
<ul>
  <li>The toolkit is implemented using generic programming principles. Such
heavily templated C++ code challenges many compilers; hence development was
carried out with the latest versions of the MSVC, Sun, gcc, Intel,
and SGI compilers.</li>
  <li>The toolkit is cross-platform (Unix, Windows and MacOSX).</li>
  <li> The toolkit supports multiple language bindings, including such 
  languages as Tcl, Python, and Java. These bindings are generated 
  automatically using an auto-wrap process. 
  <a href="http://www.itk.org/HTML/CableSwig.html">CableSwig</a> is the tool 
  we use for wrapping the code.</li>
  <li> The memory model depends on "smart pointers" that maintain a reference
  count to objects. Smart pointers can be allocated on the stack, and when
  scope is exited, the smart pointers disappear and decrement their reference
  count to the object that they refer to. </li>
  <li>The Command/Observer design pattern is used for invoking and processing
  events.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Build Environment</h3>
Insight uses the 
<a href="http://www.cmake.org">CMake</a>
(cross-platform make) build environment. CMake uses
configure and make on Unix and generates projects and workspaces in the windows
environment.<br>
<h3>Testing Environment</h3>
Insight supports an extensive testing environment. The code is tested daily
(and even continuously) on many hardware/operating system/compiler 
combinations and the results are posted daily on the 
<a href="http://public.kitware.com/dashboard.php?name=itk">Insight testing 
dashboard</a>. We use 
<a href="http://public.kitware.com/Dart/">Dart</a> to manage the testing 
process, and to post the results to the dashboard.
<br>

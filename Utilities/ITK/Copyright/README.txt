The Toolkit contains code from third parties that have different

They are:


 1) DICOMParser:  Copyright by Matt Turek.
                  Distributed under a BSD-Like license.
                  [This work was funded by NLM so its copyright
                   should probably be transfered to the ISC.]

 2) AnalyzeDB.h:  The Mayo Clinic aggreed to distribute this file
                  with ITK. Point of contact: Vincent Magnotta.
                  The file was moved to Utilities/itkExtHdrs

 3) PixelData:    GE Copyrights,
                  Vincent is contacting the providers of this
                  code too.

 6) Netlib:       Netlib is a conglomerate of packages. Each 
                  one having different copyrights and licenses.
                  Here is a listing of what is included inside
                  Utilities/vxl/v3p/netlib

    blas:         From www.netlib.org/blas :
    
    FAQ: The reference BLAS is a freely-available software package. 
    It is available from netlib via anonymous ftp and the World Wide Web. 
    Thus, it can be included in commercial software packages (and has been). 
    We only ask that proper credit be given to the authors.


    datapac:   Written by James Filliben, National Bureau of Standars.

           Our understanding is that the US Government cannot hold
           copyrights, therefore we assume that this code is in the 
           public domain.

 7) The triangle.c/h and showme.c files have been removed.
                  Their copyright/license was incompatible with
                  ITK and their functionality was not needed.
                  These removed the "itknetlib" library.


 8) itk_hash_map:  It has copyrights by SGI and HP, but the license
                  is consistent with BSD-like. So we simply need
                  to acknowledge those in our general copyright.

 9) itkMersenneTwisterRandomVariateGenerator:
                Copyright: Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura,
                Copyright: Richard J. Wagner
                under a BSD-Like license.

 10) Code/Numerics/FEM/dsrc2c.c :

                Copyright: 1977 IMSL Inc, no license available.
                Stephen Aylward removed the specific functions
                in this file that were copyrighted by IMSL and
                replaced them with other functions available in
                netlib. The file is now cleared from copyright
                concerns.


 11) Code/Numerics/cvsrmvend

                Copyright:  Greg A. Woods
                "Freely distributable"
                I guess that counts as BSD...
                Easy to remove if it becomes a problem,
                This is just a script for making easier
                the CVS syncs of VXL.

 12) Testing/Code/IO/itkIOHeaderTest.cxx:

                Copyright: National Library of Medicine.
                Actually this is created by the Tcl script

          Insight/Utilities/Dart/BuildHeadrTests.tcl

                A fix has been commited for this file.


  13) Testing/Code/Numerics/NeuralNetworks:

                Copyright: CADDLab at UNC
                Fixed now in CVS --> ISC

  D) NIFTI     :  No copyright ?
                  There is no mention of licensing nor copyright
                  at the NIFTI Web site:

                      http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1

                  However at http://niftilib.sourceforge.net it
                  appears as "public domain" license, but in
                  its subdirectory matlibs it has a GPL license.
                  The matlibs subdirectory is not included in ITK.

                  The subdirectory jlibs is public domain
                  The subdirecotry clibs is public domain


     in ITK it had a subdir:

                     University of Oxford: 
                     NO FOR COMMERCIAL USE

                     This code has now been removed.

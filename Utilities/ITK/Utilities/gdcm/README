Just a quick note on the build process of GDCM. GDCM build process
make use of the cmake software(*). This allow us:
1. To get rid of the autoconf/autotools insanity
2. Transparently generate Unix Makefiles, NMake Makefiles, 
Borland Makefiles, VS6/7/8 Project, XCode 1.5...
3. Automatic nightly testing, one of the most important thing
for a robust library/software devlpt process. GDCM devpt is develop
based on the XP definition, and to preserve backward compatibility 
make sure that code is working from one release to another: each night
we configure, we build and we test GDCM. The result are then send to 
the dashboard located at:

   http://public.kitware.com/dashboard.php?name=gdcm

A continuous dashboard make also sure that aby commit did not introduce
any error on another platform, a warning or broke a test...

Therefore you should be able to use GDCM from the bleeding edge without
knowing to much on what is going on. All you need to do is have a look
at the GDCM dashboard, and if your platform is 'green' then you can 
update your cvs copy and compile safely knowing that there are very few chances
that something won't work. Cheers !

Sources for dicom public dictionaries:
 * the official source is the part 6 of the dicom standard (see
   http://www.dclunie.com/dicom-status/status.html#BaseStandard2001).
 * http://www.fpimage.com/Manuals/Imp/dicomdic.html
   an html group based presentation.
 * ftp://rsbweb.nih.gov/pub/nih-image/documents/dicom-dict.txt
   a C syntax oriented version provided by NIH (Jim Nash)
 * http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/AFNI_Dist/afni_src.tgz
   extract mri_dicom_hdr.c (tar zxvf afni_src.tgz afni_src/mri_dicom_hdr.c)
   and look for the definitions of CMD_dictionary, META_dictionary,
   ID_dictionary, PAT_dictionary...
 * Actually, the *official* Dicom Data Dictionary 
   is on http://medical.nema.org/dicom/2003/03_06PU.pdf
   (check it every year, some tags are added, some names change)
   All C syntax oriented stuff, or anything else -but gdcm one-
   you can find on the net is very partial.
   WARNING : The Dicom Tag is an identifier inside the Dicom Dictionary,
             The Tag Name *is not*


Comment on the file NIH.dic, you can find the following discussion
on comp.protocol.dicom(*). As clearly specify by David Clunie all
thoses tags are extremely dangerous to use since they override some
other, we are only adding them to gdcm to be able to read /apparently/
some NIH images. SHOULD NOT EVER BE USED FOR WRITTING IMAGES !

No such attribute

I suspect these were taken for the draft for trial implementation
of Sup 23 SR, which was problematic in many ways, not the least
of which was that some of its attributes with the same number
were re-used with different purpose and VR, etc.

Some may have been from early drafts of other supplements (e.g.,
waveform from the looks of things).

None of these should ever be used.

they are all described:

2.5 EXTENSIONS / SPECIALIZATIONS / PRIVATIZATIONS 
If so configured, the product will send ultrasound raw data information in private data elements designated by the Private 
Creator element: 

Element Name Tag VR VM Description 
Private Creator 7FE1,00xx LO 1 GEMS_Ultrasound_MovieGroup_001
 
This means that all private tags starting with 7FE1,xx will belong to the GEMS_Ultrasound_MovieGroup_001. 
If so configured, the product will send preview image in private data elements designated by the Private Creator element: 

Element Name Tag VR VM Description 
Private Creator 6003,00xx LO 1 GEMS_Ultrasound_ImageGroup_001
 
This means that all private tags starting with 6003,00xx will belong to the GEMS_Ultrasound_ImageGroup_001

In preparation for the new Philips dictionaray with values taken from:

rename the old dictionary to avoid confusion

Basically all the dictionary should have been:

instead of
2001 1022 FL 1 Water Fat Shift


About GEMS Genie:

433  echo "http://www.gehealthcare.com/usen/fun_img/nmedicine/nmdicom/docs/confstmt.pdf" > GEMS-Genie.dic
To build GEMS-Genie I also used: http://www.gehealthcare.com/usen/fun_img/nmedicine/nmdicom/docs/2383442_100r1.pdf

434  echo "http://www.gehealthcare.com/usen/interoperability/dicom/docs/2270669_100r0_3.pdf" > GEMS-Advance.dic

According to 2270669_100r0_3.pdf, there is different interpretation for:

0009 10b3 SL 1 GE Advance ImageSet.ir_num_subsets
0009 10b4 FL 1 GE Advance ImageSet.ir_recon_fov

or:

0009 10b4 FL 1 GE Advance ImageSet.ir_num_subsets
... grrrr
ok nevermind I found also this document:

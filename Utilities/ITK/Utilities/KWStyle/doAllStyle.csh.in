#        Run KWStyle on all files in a directory.
#          Creates a subdirectory kwstyle. This subdirectory has a
#          file called 'all' that contains a list of files that show
#          the style defects for files in the directory. For each file
#          that has style defects, there is a corresponding file in
#          kwstyle with a suffix .txt that contains a description of
#          the defects.

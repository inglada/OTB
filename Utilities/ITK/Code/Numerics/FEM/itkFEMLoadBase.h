 *
 * All other load classes that can be used in a FEM system are defined by deriving this one.
 * The load class defines an external load that acts on the system. For each specific subtype 
 * of load, a separate load abstract class should be derived. For example we have LoadElement,
 * which defines the base for all loads that act on a specific element in a system.

   * Some types of external Loads may need access to previous values of
   * solution vector. If a derived class needs that, it should implement
   * this function, and store the passed pointer accordingly. If the result
   * vector is not required, the functionn should be left unimplemented,
   * so that only the dummy implementation in base class is called.

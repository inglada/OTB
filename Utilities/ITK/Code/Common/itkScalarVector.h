/** \class ScalarVector
 * \brief A templated class holding bot scalar and vector values and
 *         responding to the GetScalar() and GetVector() methods.
 * 
 * ScalarVector is a templated class that holds a scalar value plus an
 * array of values (a vector).  ScalarVector can be used as the data type
 * held at each pixel in an Image or at each vertex of an Mesh. There
 * are three template parameters: the type of scalar, the type of vector, and
 * the number of components of the vector. The types can be any data type
 * that behaves like a primitive (or atomic) data type (int, short, float,
 * complex).  itk filters that rely on scalar data assume the data type held
 * at each pixel or each vertex responds to GetScalar()/SetScalar()
 * methods. itk filters that rely on vector data assume the data type held at
 * each pixel or each vertex responds to GetVector()/SetVector() methods. If
 * not, a compile time error will occur.
 *
 * ScalarVector is not a dynamically extendible array like std::vector. It
 * is intended to be used like a mathematical vector.
 *
 * If you wish a simpler pixel types, you can use Scalar, which represents
 * a single data value at a pixel. YOu can also use Vector, which supports
 * (for a given pixel) an array of vector values.

/** \class PixelAccessor
 * \brief Give access to partial aspects of a type
 *
 * PixelAccessor is templated over an internal type and an
 * external type representation. This class encapsulates a
 * customized convertion between the internal and external
 * type representations.
 *
 * PixelAccessor is designed to be used in conjuntion with
 * ImageAdaptors. An ImageAdaptor take an image and present it
 * as another image in which the pixels are a pixel-to-pixel
 * modification of the original image.
 *
 * ImageAdaptors are intended to perform task similar to ImageFilters,
 * but reducing the overhead in memory allocation, at the price of some
 * reduction in performance.
 *
 * ImageAdaptors are templated over a PixelAccessor class that
 * will define what kind of transformation is applied to the 
 * pixel data.  Typical uses of PixelAccessor include basic type
 * casting, (e.g. make a float image looks like a unsigned int image).
 *
 * Every Image has a default PixelAccessor that performs an identity
 * operation. ImageIterators use the PixelAccessor defined by the image
 * in order to get and set the values of pixels.
 *
 * \ingroup ImageAdaptors

/** \class WeakPointer
 * \brief Implements a weak reference to an object.
 *
 * WeakPointer implements a weak reference to an object. A natural
 * interface to the class is defined by operator -> (and *) among others.
 * WeakPointer is really nothing more than a standard pointer.  It is used
 * to call attention to the fact that it does not adjust the reference
 * count of an object like SmartPointer does.  WeakPointer is used internally
 * to Insight to manage (break) reference counting loops. At some point,
 * an object may keep track of how many objects hold weak references to
 * itself. In all cases, however, an outstanding weak reference will not
 * keep an object from destructing.

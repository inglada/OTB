/** \class LightProcessObject
 * \brief LightProcessObject is the base class for all process objects (source,
          filters, mappers) in the Insight data processing pipeline.
 *
 * LightProcessObject is an abstract object that specifies behavior and
 * interface of visualization network process objects (sources, filters,
 * mappers). Source objects are creators of visualization data; filters
 * input, process, and output visualization data; and mappers transform data
 * into another form (like rendering primitives or write data to a file).
 *
 * A major role of LightProcessObject is to define the inputs and outputs
 * of a filter. More than one input and/or output may exist for a given
 * filter. Some classes (e.g., source objects or mapper objects) will
 * not use inputs (the source) or outputs (mappers). In this case, the
 * inputs or outputs is just ignored.
 *
 * LightProcessObject invokes the following events: 
 * , Command::StartEvent, Command::EndEvent
 * These are convenience events you can use for any purpose
 * (e.g., debugging info, highlighting/notifying user interface, etc.) 
 * See Command and LightObject for information on using AddObserver.
 *
 * Another event Command::ProgressEvent can be observed. Some filters invoke
 * this event periodically during their execution (with the progress,
 * parameter, the fraction of work done). The use is similar to that of
 * StartEvent and EndEvent. Filters may also check their
 * AbortGenerateData flag to determine whether to prematurally end their
 * execution.
 *
 * An important feature of subclasses of LightProcessObject is that it is
 * possible to control the memory-management model (i.e., retain output
 * versus delete output data). If enabled the ReleaseDataFlag enables the
 * deletion of the output data once the downstream process object finishes
 * processing the data (please see text).
 *
 * Subclasses of LightProcessObject may override 4 of the methods of this class
 * to control how a given filter may interact with the pipeline (dataflow).
 * These methods are: GenerateOutputInformation(),
 * EnlargeOutputRequestedRegion(), GenerateInputRequestedRegion(), and
 * GenerateOutputRequestedRegion(). By overriding these methods, a filter
 * can deviate from the base assumptions of the pipeline execution model.

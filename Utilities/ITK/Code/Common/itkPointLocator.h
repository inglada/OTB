/** \class PointLocator
 * \brief Accelerate geometric searches for points.
 *
 * This class accelerates the search for n-dimensional points. The class
 * operates by using a regular n-dimensional hypercube lattice (e.g., a 2D
 * grid, 3D volume, etc.) into which points are inserted. Each hypercube
 * (also called a bucket) contains a list of points that are contained within
 * it.
 *
 * Template parameters for PointLocator:
 *
 * TPointIdentifier =
 *     The type used to access a particular point (i.e., a point's id)
 *
 * TCoordRep =
 *     Numerical type with which to represent each coordinate value.
 *
 * VPointDimension =
 *    Geometric dimension of space.

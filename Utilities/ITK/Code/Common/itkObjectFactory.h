/** \class ObjectFactory
 * \brief Create instances of a class.
 *
 * ObjectFactory is a helper class used to created instances of a
 * class. Object factories are used for instantiation because they allow
 * run-time replacement of a class with a user-supplied version. For
 * example, if you wished to replace an algorithm with your own custom
 * version, or with a hardware-accelerated version, ObjectFactory
 * can be used to do this.
 *
 * This implementation of the object factory is templated and uses RTTI
 * (Run-Time Type Information) to create the name of the class it is to
 * instantiate. (The name may include template type parameters, depending
 * on the class definition.)
 *

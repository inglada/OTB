During generating otb::MapProjection<ossimLlxyProjection>, pb with polymorphism :
  virtual void computeMetersPerPixel(		double deltaDegreesPerPixelLat,
                                            double deltaDegreesPerPixelLon,
                                            ossimDpt &metersPerPixel)
   The method is redefined in the file "ossimLlxyProjection.h"

The SConscript in this directory is a project-specific build file. Otherwise,
all code here is strictly third-party contributions and platform-specific
built libraries.

For KMZ reading we use the minizip contrib package that comes with zlib (see
DEPENDENCIES). To avoid compiling third-party sources into our code, we build
minizip as a separate library. These are built from a temporary modification
of the SConscript in src/kml/util:
  env.Append(LIBS=[env['LIBZ']])
  minizip_files = [
    '#/third_party/zlib-1.2.3/contrib/minizip/unzip.c',
    '#/third_party/zlib-1.2.3/contrib/minizip/ioapi.c',
    '#/third_party/zlib-1.2.3/contrib/minizip/zip.c',
  ]
  env.Library(target='minizip', source=minizip_files)
  env.SharedLibrary(target='minizip', source=minizip_files)
The resultant binaries are then copied out to
third_party/zlib-1.2.3.PLATFORM/{bin|lib}. For convenience, we supply
pre-built copies of the minizip library for windows, mac and linux.

Welcome to libkml!

This is the source code for the libkml project.

See the wiki release notes to get started:
http://code.google.com/p/libkml/wiki/UserGuide01x

Style Notes:
- The "using namespace xxx" declaration is explicitly forbidden.
- Declarations of the form "using kmldom::Element*" are permissible. However,
  we explicitly avoid the use of "using std::string".

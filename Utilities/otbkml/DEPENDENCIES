This file records the source URL and version of each external package
used by libkml. Other versions may work fine, but you'll be less
on your own if you use these exact versions as well.

Required:
g++: 4.0.1, 4.0.3 (or MS Visual Studio 2005 on Windows)
expat: expat.sourceforge.net 2.0.1
zlib: www.zlib.net 1.2.3

Optional:
cppunit: cppunit.sourceforge.net 1.12.0, 1.12.1
java: java.sun.com 1.5.0_13, 1.6.0_04
python: www.python.org 2.3.4, 2.4.4, 2.5.1
swig: www.swig.org 1.3.35

Development:
automake: www.gnu.org/software/automake 1.9.6
autoconf: www.gnu.org/software/autoconf 2.59
libtool: www.gnu.org/software/libtool 1.5

Note that since libkml does not use RTTI, your cppunit libraries have to be
configured as follows:

On Mac OS X:
./configure --disable-typeinfo-name
This is because libkml explicitly does not use RTTI.

On Linux:
./configure --disable-typeinfo-name LIBS="-ldl"

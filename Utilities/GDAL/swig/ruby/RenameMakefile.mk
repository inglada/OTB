# This makefile creates renames.i which provides
# mappings from C++ CamelCase names to ruby
# under_score names. To run this makefile:
#
#	make -f RenameMakeile.mk build 
#
# The makefile works by first generating swig bindings.  Based
# on the created bindings, it then generates %rename
# and %alias directives and saves them to a file
# called renames.i that is included by the main
# typemap_ruby.i file.  It then deletes the swig generated
# wrappers so that they can later be regenerated taking
# into account the new %rename and %alias directives.

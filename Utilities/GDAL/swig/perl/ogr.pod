=head1 NAME

ogr - A part of the Perl interface to the GDAL library.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ogr;

=head1 ABSTRACT

This module is a part of the Perl bindings to the GDAL library. The
GDAL modules allows you to access and manipulate from Perl all
geospatial data that the installed GDAL library is configured to
read/write.

=head1 STATUS

This modules is early beta quality. As most of the names and calling
conventions come directly from the underlying GDAL library they are
quite stable and will continue to work like the do now. However, many
things could, should, and will be made more perlish.

Generally, those methods which are documented, have been tested. If
the method or constructor you are looking for is not documented,
perhaps there is another way of doing what you want to do.

=head1 KNOWN BUGS

The reference counting scheme is not yet implemented. Make sure that
parents are not deleted before their children! Use "my" a lot.  Do not
give undefined/uninitialized variables to methods.

<h1>ESRI Personal GeoDatabase</h1>

OGR optionally supports reading ESRI Personal GeoDatabase .mdb files via ODBC.
Personal GeoDatabase is a Microsoft Access database with a set of tables
defined by ESRI for holding geodatabase metadata, and with geometry for
features held in a BLOB column in a custom format (essentially Shapefile
geometry fragments).  This drivers accesses the personal geodatabase via
ODBC but does not depend on any ESRI middleware.<p>

Personal Geodatabases are accessed by passing the filename of the .mdb file to 
be accessed as the datasource name.  No ODBC DSN is required.<p>

OGR treats all feature tables as layers.  Most geometry types should be
supported, including 3D data.  Measures information will be discarded. 
Coordinate system information should be properly associated with layers. <p>

Currently the OGR Personal Geodatabase driver does not take advantage of
spatial indexes for fast spatial queries, though that may be added in the
future. <p>

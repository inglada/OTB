OTB Examples Directory
----------------------

This directory contains simple, companion examples to the ORFEO
Toolbox (OTB). These examples are designed to demonstrate features of
the system; they are not meant to be significant applications of the
software (see the separate directory OTB-Applications for such
applications).

Specifically, the purpose of these examples is as follows:

   * Provide simple, minimalist examples of important features of OTB and how
     to use them. The examples have minimal dependencies on outside packages;
     and if they do, there should be CMake flags to turn them off.

   * Provide a consistent set of examples that will work in conjunctions with
     the OTB Software Guide.

   * Provide a consistent set of examples that will work with OTB tutorials
     and courses.

   * Make sure that the code is well documented, of consistent style, and
     always up-to-date with the current OTB code.

The following is a list of subdirectories with a description of the code
found in them.

   * Installation - a very simple example to demonstrate compiling against
     the OTB libraries and configuring CMake.

   * DataRepresentation - creating images and meshes; shows the basics of
     creating and executing the pipeline

   * Iterators - iterating over images and meshes.
   
   * IO - the basics of reading/writing data.

   * Filtering - examples of image processing and mesh filters.

   * FeatureExtraction - examples of low-level information extraction.

   * ChangeDetection - detecting changes between pairs of images.

   * Learning - Support Vector Machine examples.
   
   * MultiScale - Multiscale examples.

   * Classification - simple examples of image classification.

   * Segmentation - a suite of basic segmentation examples.

   * Visu - simple examples for image visualization.

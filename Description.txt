Remote sensing processing library developped by CNES ORFEO Toolbox (OTB) is
  distributed as an open source library of image processing algorithms. OTB is
  based on the medical image processing library ITK and offers particular
  functionalities for remote sensing image processing in general and for high
  spatial resolution images in particular. OTB is distributed under a free
  software licence CeCILL (similar to GPL) to encourage contribution from users
  and to promote reproducible research. The library is intensively tested on
  several platforms as Linux, Unix and Windows. Most functionnalies are also
  adapted to process huge images using streaming and multithreading as often as
  possible.
  .
  Among other, OTB provides a number of heavily documented functionalities as
  .
  image access: optimized read/write access for most of remote sensing image
  formats, meta-data access, visualization;
  filtering: blurring, denoising, enhancement;
  feature extraction: interest points, alignments, lines;
  image segmentation: region growing, watershed, level sets;
  classification: K-means, SVM, Markov random fields;
  change detection.
  .
  OTB rely on itk, gdal, ossim, libsvm among others.

***Notes for those who do not read the doc***

We assume that you will install everything on a directory called
INSTALL_DIR, which usually is /usr/local, /home/jordi/local or
whatever you want.

Make sure that you have downloaded the source code for:
       - CMake (http://www.cmake.org)
       - GDAL (http://www.gdal.org/)
       - Fltk (http://www.fltk.org)

Installation on Linux/Unix platforms
------------------------------------

NB: On some linux plateforme, you may (and should) use the official distribution packages for gdal, cmake and fltk

1. Install GDAL (or use your distribution package):
      cd INSTALL_DIR
      gunzip gdal.1.5.2.tar.gz
      tar xvf gdal.1.5.2.tar
      cd gdal.1.5.2
      ./configure --prefix=INSTALL_DIR
      make
      make install

2. Install CMake (or use your distribution package):
      cd INSTALL_DIR
      gunzip cmake-2.6.0.tar.gz
      tar xvf cmake-2.6.0.tar
      cd cmake-2.6.0
      ./configure --prefix=INSTALL_DIR
      make
      make install

      In order to properly use cmake, add INSTALL_DIR/bin to your path
      with export PATH=$PATH:INSTALL_DIR/bin or something similar.

3. Install Fltk using CMake (do not use the configure script) (or use your distribution package)

      cd INSTALL_DIR
      bunzip2 fltk-1.1.9-source.tar.bz2 OR
      gunzip fltk-1.1.9-source.tar.gz
      mkdir Fltk-binary
      cd Fltk-binary
      ccmake ../fltk-1.1.9
      --> follow the CMake instructions, in particular:
          --> set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to INSTALL_DIR within CMake
	  --> set BUILD_EXAMPLES to ON within CMake
	  --> generate the configuration with 'g'
      make
      make install
      --> check that the examples located in
      INSTALL_DIR/Fltk-binary/bin work, in particular, the fractals
      example which makes use of the OpenGL library needed by OTB.

4. Install OTB

      cd INSTALL_DIR
      gunzip OrfeoToolbox-2.6.0.tgz
      tar xvf OrfeoToolbox-2.6.0.tar
      mkdir OTB-Binary
      cd OTB-Binary
      ccmake ../OrfeoToolbox-2.6.0
      --> follow the CMake instructions, in particular:
	  --> set BUILD_EXAMPLES to ON within CMake
	  --> set BUILD_SHARED_LIBS to OFF within CMake
	  --> set BUILD_TESTING to OFF within CMake
	  --> set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to INSTALL_DIR within CMake
	  --> set GDAL_INCLUDE_DIRS to INSTALL_DIR/include within CMake
	  --> set GDAL_LIBRARY_DIRS to INSTALL_DIR/lib within CMake
	  --> set OTB_USE_EXTERNAL_ITK to OFF within CMake
	  --> set FLTK_DIR to INSTALL_DIR/Fltk-Binary within CMake
	  --> generate the configuration with 'g'
       make
       make install
      

Installation on Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003 (7.1)
-------------------------------------------------------

1. Install GDAL

	MSVC++ 7.1 project files are needed to compile GDAL.
	These files can be downloaded at http://vterrain.org/dist/gdal151-vc71.zip.
	Then, unzip it to your GDAL folder, and it will create a folder (named "VisualStudio").
	Load the solution (.sln file) and build the gdal project.
	More details can be found at http://vterrain.org/Distrib/gdal.html.

2. Install Fltk

	Use CMake on Windows to generate MSVC++ 7.1 project files from fltk sources.
	Open the solution and build the fltk project.

3. Install OTB

	Use CMake on Windows to generate MSVC++ 7.1 project files from otb sources.
		Open the solution and build the otb project.


Installation on Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2005 (8.0)
-------------------------------------------------------

1. Install GDAL

        Open a MS-DOS prompt.
        Run the VCVARS32.bat script that comes with the compiler (it can be found in 
        Microsoft Visual Studio 8/VC/bin).
        Then, go to the GDAL root directory, and tape : 
                nmake /f makefile.vc
        Once the build is successful, tape this line to install GDAL :
                nmake /f makefile.vc install
   
        More details about this install can be found at www.gdal.org/gdal_building.html.
                
2. Install Fltk

	Use CMake on Windows to generate MSVC++ 8.0 project files from fltk sources.
	Open the solution and build the fltk project.

3. Install OTB

	Use CMake on Windows to generate MSVC++ 8.0 project files from otb sources.
	Open the solution and build the otb project.


Installation with MinGW on Windows platform
-------------------------------------------

0. Install MinGW

	Download the lastest version of mingw and msys at http://www.mingw.org and install those 
	two programs.
	Then, launch MinGW : a promp appears (similar to Linux one).

1. Install GDAL

	To compile GDAL, at configure step, use these options :
		./configure -prefix=INSTALL_DIR --host=mingw32 --without-libtool 
		--without-python --with-png=internal --with-libtiff=internal
		--with-jpeg=internal

	Then lauch the usual make and make install.

2. Install Fltk

	Generate MSYS Makefiles with CMake (Windows version) from fltk sources.
	Then, under prompt, tape make and make install where you have generated Makefiles with CMake.

3. Install OTB

	Similar to fltk install.


Installation on Cygwin platform
-------------------------------

0. Install Cygwin

	Download the lastest version at http://www.cygwin.com and install it.
	Then, launch it, a prompt appears (similar to Linux one).

1. Install GDAL

	To compile GDAL, at configure step, use these options :
		./configure --prefix=INSTALL_DIR --with-png=internal --with-libtiff=internal
		--with-jpeg=internal

	Then lauch the usual make and make install.

2. Install Fltk

	See Linux part for details (same procedure).

3. Install OTB

	See Linux part for details (same procedure).




That should be all! Otherwise, subscribe to
   otb-users@googlegroups.com and you will get some help.



** Sun OS ans HP UX users **
----------------------------

Please make sure that you use the GNU tar command, since the tar
command shipped with Sun workstations may give problems. See
<http://groups.google.com/group/otb-users/browse_thread/thread/3758159f06092ae4>
for details.


** Cygwin users **
------------------

Due to an unknown bug, Fltk can't compile on some versions of Cygwin (OpenGL problems).
Put OTB_USE_VISU_GUI to OFF to avoid these problems.

Some bugs can appear while compiling GDAL with JPEG2000 files : disable this format to resolve the problem.


** Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2005 (8.0) users **
---------------------------------------------------

Execution errors can appear on some platforms, using GDAL compiled with MSVC++ 8.0.

This problem can be resolved by downloading GDAL binaries for Windows
at http://vterrain.org/Distrib/gdal.html.

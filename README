Installation on Linux/Unix platforms
------------------------------------

0. We assume that you will install everything on a directory called
INSTALL_DIR, which usually is /usr/local, /home/jordi/local or
whatever you want.
1. Make sure that you have downloaded the source code for:
       - CMake (http://www.cmake.org)
       - GDAL (http://www.gdal.org/)
       - Fltk (http://www.fltk.org)

2. Install GDAL:
      cd INSTALL_DIR
      gunzip gdal.1.3.2.tar.gz
      tar xvf gdal.1.3.2.tar
      cd gdal.1.3.2
      ./configure --prefix=INSTALL_DIR
      make
      make install

3. Install CMake:
      cd INSTALL_DIR
      gunzip cmake-2.2.3.tar.gz
      tar xvf cmake-2.2.3.tar
      cd cmake-2.2.3
      ./configure --prefix=INSTALL_DIR
      make
      make install

      In order to properly use cmake, add INSTALL_DIR/bin to your path
      with export PATH=$PATH:INSTALL_DIR/bin or something similar.

4. Install Fltk using CMake (do not use the configure script)

      cd INSTALL_DIR
      bunzip2 fltk-1.1.7-source.tar.bz2 OR
      gunzip fltk-1.1.7-source.tar.gz
      mkdir Fltk-binary
      cd Fltk-binary
      ccmake ../fltk-1.1.7
      --> follow the CMake instructions, in particular:
          --> set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to INSTALL_DIR within CMake
	  --> set BUILD_EXAMPLES to ON within CMake
	  --> generate the configuration with 'g'
      make
      make install
      --> check that the examples located in
      INSTALL_DIR/Fltk-binary/bin work, in particular, the fractals
      example which makes use of the OpenGL library needed by OTB.

5. Install OTB

      cd INSTALL_DIR
      gunzip OrfeoToolbox-1.0.0.tgz
      tar xvf OrfeoToolbox-1.0.0.tar
      mkdir OTB-Binary
      cd OTB-Binary
      ccmake ../OrfeoToolbox-1.0.0
      --> follow the CMake instructions, in particular:
	  --> set BUILD_EXAMPLES to ON within CMake
	  --> set BUILD_SHARED_LIBS to OFF within CMake
	  --> set BUILD_TESTING to OFF within CMake
	  --> set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to INSTALL_DIR within CMake
	  --> set GDAL_INCLUDE_DIRS to INSTALL_DIR/include within CMake
	  --> set GDAL_LIBRARY_DIRS to INSTALL_DIR/lib within CMake
	  --> set OTB_USE_EXTERNAL_ITK to OFF within CMake
	  --> set FLTK_DIR to INSTALL_DIR/Fltk-Binary within CMake
	  --> generate the configuration with 'g'
       make
       make install
